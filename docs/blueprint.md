## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Light CMYK-friendly blue (#66B2FF) to provide a calm, reliable backdrop reminiscent of the scientific precision and clarity desired in an inventory system. A less saturated blue makes the app less visually stressful.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0) to create a clean, uncluttered workspace for ease of data management.
- Accent color: Soft, bright yellow (#FFFF99) to highlight critical alerts and interactive elements, drawing user attention where needed most, in a non-intrusive way.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif known for its neutrality and legibility, which is well-suited to the tabular data typical of inventory management systems.
- Implement a responsive design using grid or flexbox to ensure the inventory application displays correctly across all device sizes.
- Utilize subtle motion animations for loading states and interactive elements to improve user experience.
- Employ clear, universally understood icons for inventory actions (add, delete, edit) to aid user comprehension.
